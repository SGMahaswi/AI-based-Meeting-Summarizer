# EchoMind AI

## Overview

The **EchoMind AI** is a Gradio-powered application that converts audio recordings of meetings into transcripts and provides concise summaries using `whisper.cpp` for audio-to-text conversion and `Ollama` for text summarization. This tool is ideal for quickly extracting key points, decisions, and action items from meetings.
